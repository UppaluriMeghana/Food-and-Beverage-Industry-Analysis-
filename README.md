CodeX, a German beverage company, recently introduced its energy drink in 10 Indian cities. The Marketing team surveyed 10,000 participants in these cities to better understand brand recognition, market presence, and product preferences. The aim is to analyze the survey findings and offer actionable suggestions to the marketing team. I used MySQL to analyze the results from Excel data, created a Power BI dashboard, and made recommendations based on these insights. This report will help the team identify potential challenges and potentially increase their market share by at least 30%.
